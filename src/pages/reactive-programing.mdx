## Hello worlds

Thanks to IntersectionObserver we have a small but very efficient bit of code to create our table of 
contents, provide quick links to jump around the document and update readers on where they are in a document as they read.

```js
console.log('Hello worlds');
```

## HTML

```html
<div>Hellow</div>
```

```javascript
const x = 'This is cool';

console.log('HHDHWHD', x);
```
